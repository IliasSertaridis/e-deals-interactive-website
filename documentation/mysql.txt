The MySQL database is initialized through docker-compose.yml through ./SQL:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d volume, where every script in that folder is automatically executed on initialization of the cointainer, provided the /var/lib/mysql directory (db-data commented volume) is clear (no prior data in mysql server).

The db-data volume has been commented out to automatically "refresh" the database on startup, maintaining homogeneity in execution environments.

To keep data that is persistent from execution to execution, uncomment the aforementioned db-data volume line in docker-compose.yml
